[![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/FsPickler.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FsPickler/)

FsPickler is a serialization library that facilitates the distribution of .NET objects.
The implementation focuses on performance and completeness in supported types, including F# types.
It supports multiple, pluggable serialization formats including Binary, Xml, JSON and BSON.
The library is based on the functional programming concept of 
[pickler combinators](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2243) 
which has been adapted to accommodate the object oriented nature of the .NET framework.

Packages of the library are available on Nuget [[1](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FsPickler),[2](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FsPickler.Json),[3](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FsPickler.CSharp)].
